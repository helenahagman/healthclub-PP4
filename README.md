## Why this project
I built this page for my 4th project in the Code Institute course for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. I wanted to build a good-looking website where the functionality for online booking of Personal Trainer sessions would be possible and where both the user and the owner of the site can get the information they need. As building an online booking for Personal Trainer Sessions will be one of my projects for my current job as well this fall, I used the opportunity to talk to my boss for user stories and planning of the project. Key points that would be crucial for the real site have been a part of this project.

### Features
The website contains three main pages: start/about page, Personal Trainer page, Members page. All main pages are accessible from the navigation menu on the top of the page.

#### All main pages:
- Responsive navigation menu on the top of the page to be able to navigate to the three main pages. The links to the pages are placed on the right side of the navigation bar, to the left a logo with the project name is placed.
- In the footer, social media links to Facebook and Instagram are placed in the form of icons.

#### Start/about page:
- Short descriptive information along with an image followed by two postcards with a link to the Personal Trainer page and the Member Page.

#### Personal Trainer Page:
- Short descriptive information along with an image and a button to book a session, below that two postcards with a link to book sessions and the Member Page.

#### Member Page:
- Short descriptive information along with an image, below that two postcards with a link to the contact form and the login and register form.

## Accessibility
Throughout the process of building the website, I have tried to think of accessibility to make it as user-friendly as possible. I have used the best of my knowledge to:
- Use semantic HTML
- Ensure sufficient color contrasts
- Use images that fit the purpose
- Add hover functionality on menu items and buttons
- Use icons for social media links instead of text
- Maintain the same layout on all main pages

## Technology
### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Django, Flask
- GitHub - save & store website files
- CodeAnywhere - codespace
- Bootstrap - framework
- Favicon - icons
- ElephantSQL - database
- Heroku - deployment
- EmailJS - contact
- Trello - KANBAN Board
- Miro - wireframes
